Support:
WebRTC is supported in Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Android and iOS.

Security:
Encryption is mandatory for all WebRTC components.  You can only use the JS API from securure origins (and localhost for debugging).

Signaling:
WebRTC requires a mechanism to coordinate the communication between peer clients and also to send control messages.  Signaling protocols are not specified by WebRTC.

STUN and TURN:
In the real world, P2P communication is not always easy (NAT gateways and firewalls).
The STUN server gets the IP address of your computer, and the TURN server acts as a relay if p2p fails.
