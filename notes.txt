What is WebRTC:
Real Time Communication APIs used for video, audio and arbitrary data.

Credit:
I stole most of this from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web/

Support:
WebRTC is supported in Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Android and iOS.

Security:
Encryption is mandatory for all WebRTC components.  You can only use the JS API from securure origins (and localhost for debugging).

Signaling:
WebRTC requires a mechanism to coordinate the communication between peer clients and also to send control messages.  Signaling protocols are not specified by WebRTC.

STUN and TURN:
In the real world, P2P communication is not always easy (NAT gateways and firewalls).
The STUN server gets the IP address of your computer, and the TURN server acts as a relay if p2p fails.

Tools:
 - Express (serving up files locally, can use any server)
 - webrtc-adapter
 -- There are some differences in the WebRTC apis across browsers.  The webrtc-adapter library (available as an NPM package) standardizes these.

Getting started (live coding / quickstart):
 - Use an HTML video element.  Be sure to include the `autoplay` attribute, otherwise you'll only get a single frame.
 - Add the webrtc-adapter library
 - Create the javascript to get the video feed
 -- Create a constraints object (more on this later)
 -- Use the adapter's promise based api `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
 --- Set the video's srcObject (not compatible with older browsers)
 -- Show a couple options for the constraints object
